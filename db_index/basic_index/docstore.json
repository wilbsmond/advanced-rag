running a startup. And, of course, we continue to learn. Therefore it's a document that will continue to change. \n\nEverything related to working at Blendle and the people of Blendle, made public.\nThese are the lessons from three years of working with the people of Blendle. It contains everything from \nhow our leaders lead\n to \nhow we increase salaries\n, from \nhow we hire\n and \nfire\n to \nhow we think people should give each other feedback\n \u2014 and much more.\nWe've made this document public because we want to learn from you. We're very much interested in your feedback (including weeding out typo's and Dunglish ;)). Email us at hr@blendle.com. If you're starting your own company or if you're curious as to how we do things at Blendle, we hope that our employee handbook inspires you.\nIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \njob ads here\n.

We will set you up with a personal Google account (\n\t\t\t[username]@blendle.com\n\t\t\t), which is your identity within Blendle. You can use this account to sign in to both internal (e.g. 'goals', 'get-a-room') and external apps and services (through single sign-on).\n\t\t\tPart 1: setting up your accounts and tools\n\t\t\tYou can log in at: \n\t\t\thttp\n\t\t\ts\n\t\t\t://www.google.com/a/blendle.com\n\t\t\tNote that two-step verification is mandatory. You will be required to set this up at your first login. You can find more information at \n\t\t\tthe help page\n\t\t\t.\n\n\t\t\tSlack\n\t\t\tWe use Slack for internal communication. This gives us all the ability to stalk each other,\u00a0use GIFs, work on Slack-bots, etc. etc. It comes as a web app, iOS app, Android App, OSX app and Windows app. Just download the apps for your platforms of choice. With \n\t\t\tthis link\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\tyou can create your own Slack account with your @blendle account (SSO for the win!). You can join all the revenant channels of your choice. Slack can also be a big distraction, so make sure to \n\t\t\tcheck out the do-not-disturb-functionalities\n\t\t\t.\n\t\t\t If you run into any trouble, just let me know.\n\n\t\t\tTrello\n\t\t\tI\u2019ve also sent you an invite (on your Blendle mail) for Trello. We use it for all sorts of things. Of course the occasional sprint planning but support uses it to flag issues and get them on sprints for example. \n\t\t\tHere you\u2019ll find\n\t\t\t (not a public link) the overview board for the whole of Blendle. Have a look around. When joining your team you\u2019ll know soon enough which board to join.\n\n\t\t\tCluster\n\t\t\tThis neat little photo and video sharing app is the one we use to share fun Blendle memories.

Just know that you\u2019re free to sit anywhere you like. Just know that further to the back (behind the meeting rooms) we like to keep things quiet. Just to keep focus :). To improve focus we have one rule called the headphone-rule. Headphones on means \"do not disturb\". Pretty straight-forward, but it works.\n\t\t\tMore practical information about our office and door lock can be found \n\t\t\there\n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\tMassage\n\t\t\tEvery week on Wednesday from 12.30-16.00h (might change, see the all@ calendar), we have a masseuse come by to relieve us from stress (what stress), RSI, that aching back or tiredness. And yes its great! There is no queue, just a free-for-all.\n\n\t\t\tHeadspace\n\t\t\tTo keep your head in shape, we pay for the best apps to help you do so: Headspace to stay calm and mindful and \n\t\t\tThings\n\t\t\t to boost your productivity and help you reach your goals. Blendle offers reimbursement on your Headspace subscription. Leave your name \n\t\t\there\n\t\t\t and you will receive a monthly reimbursement together with your salary.\n\n\t\t\tLunch\n\t\t\tAt Blendle we tend to lunch together. Buurtboer arranges nice lunches including sandwiches (to be self-made), salad, eggs and veggies. Just get your plate, walk to the salad bar (yes we got a salad bar from Marktplaats for 100 euros), grab whatever you like and enjoy the company of your colleagues (or don\u2019t, whatever). Any allergies or preferences? Let us know at \n\t\t\tofficemanagement@blendle.com\n\t\t\t.\n\t\t\tDon\u2019t be afraid to help out on cleaning up after lunch. You\u2019ll experience this thing called gratitude if you do\u2026\n\n\t\t\tSick?\n\t\t\tTough luck! Get over it! No, we care for each other so we will feel sorry for you. And everyone is willing to help out if you get in a tough spot being ill at home. To get the needed help or rest, just let your team know you\u2019re staying at home (or going home) via email (hr@blendle.com) and let us know. I will need to put this in our scrapbook.\n\n\t\t\tOfficial Holidays and Vacay!\n\t\t\tOf course, we ain\u2019t all workaholics, but we don\u2019t have any CAO (collective employment agreement) with loads of bylaws. But we do have some official holidays. Be sure to check them out in the Handbook. If you want to head out to enjoy your well-deserved vacation then there is only 1 rule, and 1 rule to rule them all: check/discuss with your team and team lead and then put it in your calendar and @all calendar (for administrative reasons).\n\n\t\t\tYour payslip\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\tAfter onboarding you'll receive an email from noreply@loket.nl:\n\n\t\t\tVan: <noreply@loket.nl>\u00a0\nAan: <>\u00a0Cc:\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\tBeste collega,\n\nWelkom bij het Werknemerloket van Blendle B.V.\n\nJe bent nu slechts \u00e9\u00e9n stap verwijderd van je toegang tot het Werknemerloket.\n\nGa naar: \n\t\t\thttps://werknemer.loket.nl/#/login?token=\n\t\t\t................. en maak eenvoudig een account aan.

Denk hierbij aan de veiligheid: kies een sterk wachtwoord!\n\nVoor overige vragen kan je contact opnemen met Blendle B.V.\n\n\n\t\t\tThis email will most probably be sent to your private email address. Via this email you'll get access to \n\t\t\twerknemersloket.nl \n\t\t\twhere you can see your monthly payslip. \n\n\n\t\t\tSecurity\n\t\t\tWe care about security. So, whenever possible (Google apps, GitHub etc): use two-factor authentication! And please turn on Full Disk Encryption (FileVault on Mac) on your computer. And of course, whether you're at the office or somewhere else,\u00a0be sure to lock your computer whenever you are AFK. And whenever you hear \u201cBrace, Brace!\u201d, be sure to get yourself into brace-position. It is for your own and our safety. :-)\n\t\t\tFor sharing secure stuff with each other we use \n\t\t\tTresorit\n\t\t\t. Be sure to download that! If you need it, your team will also mention this, so don\u2019t worry! Oh, and in case you\u2019re wondering: we don\u2019t share any user information via Slack or Google.\n\n\t\t\t1Password\n\t\t\tYou should use a password manager to manage your secrets (e.g. passwords for your personal accounts or credit card details). This allows you to use \n\t\t\tunique\n\t\t\t passwords for your different accounts.\n\t\t\tYou can sign up for 1Password for Teams \n\t\t\there\n\t\t\t (not public).\n\t\t\tAND Mooooore....\n\t\t\tRecruitment\n\t\t\tThis might be one of the most important questions: Who would you like to work with? You might have noticed: we\u2019re expanding! While trying to conquer the world, we need to gather our own army of super-duper extraterrestrial-powered heroes (you know them as your colleagues). We still have a lot of vacancies open\u2026 but apart from them, we\u2019re always looking for new recruits. So, do you know anyone fitting the (or a) profile? Let them know we\u2019re looking for \u2018em or let HR know they need to contact them.\n\n\t\t\tBusiness intelligence\n\t\t\tSounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant. You get all the tools you need and acces to all the data. \n\t\t\tGo to this page (made by the BI peeps) and go nuts\n\t\t\t (not public).\n\n\t\t\tParty 3: Let\u2019s intro the shit out of this:\n\t\t\tIntroduce yourself!!1!\n\t\t\tYou\u2019ve made it to the end of this post. Respect. Last but not least is introducing yourself. How? Just send an email to \n\t\t\tall@blendle.com\n\t\t\t before your first day.\n\t\t\tFirst impressions count (no pressure) and \n\t\t\there are all the intro emails\n\t\t\t (not public) of the colleagues who joined before you (no pressure), make sure to add your own too (again, no pressure).\n\t\t\tAs you can see, it grew into one big funny gif-fest, which wasn\u2019t our intention ;).\n\t\t\tThe idea behind it is that your new colleagues get a glimpse of who you are, what you like/dislike, why you are joining Blendle and what you\u2019re going to do.

Marten and Alexander expected a few friends and partners to show up in an old warehouse in Amsterdam for their 'launch' party. 30 minutes before the start, the room filled with cameras and reporters. More then enough people were interested to see and hear what they came up with. Even PowNews sent a reporter:\n\n\n\t\t\tA little rewind: in 2011, Marten found himself in a bookstore, a bit frustrated, looking at a magazine (as reenacted beautifully in this picture below). He was frustrated that he had to buy the whole magazine, whereas he only wanted to read one article from it. The first idea for Blendle was born and was called MyMagazine. He started talking to a lot of people in the media world, including Alexander. Alexander wasn't convinced yet.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIn \n\t\t\tmid-2012\n\t\t\t, Marten asked Jort to make the first sketches and wireframes. \n\t\t\tJune 2012\n\t\t\t, these are the first sketches of Blendle:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAlexander and Marten stay in touch and, after seeing the first sketches, Alexander sees the potential and decides to join. Together they have an 'office' in the staircase of the science centre Nemo in Amsterdam. With the prototypes and Alexander on board, the conversations with the publishers actually start to get interesting. Alexander and Marten take all the feedback and criticism from the publishers back to their 'office' and keep improving the product.\n\t\t\tIn \n\t\t\tSeptember 2013, \n\t\t\tBlendle received\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t100,000 euros from a fund for innovation in journalism.\n\t\t\t5 September 2013:\n\t\t\t First announcement of Blendle in the Dutch TV show DWDD: \n\n\n\n\t\t\t28 April 2014:\n\t\t\t Launch in NL\n\n\t\t\tIn the meantime, Blendle got an office upgrade and moved to the Jaarbeurs in the beautiful Utrecht.

Hey \n\t\t\tFNAME\n\t\t\t 500 times.\n\n\n\t\t\tSo what is culture:\n\t\t\t 'Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, defined by everything from language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts.'\n\t\t\tOr:\n\t\t\t'the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time'.\n\t\t\tIt is basically our 'way of life'. Putting our set of values or our way of life in writing wasn't an easy task. Mainly because the moment we started putting this in writing, it already altered. We started with a set of Blendle peeps writing down every word that came to mind when thinking about Blendle. We made categories and tried making sentences out of it. We shared that with the whole group, got some good feedback and slimmed it down to 8 slick posters. The result is far from perfect or complete but is 80% done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWork at Blendle\n\t\t\tIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \n\t\t\tjob ads here\n\t\t\t.

We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:\n\t\t\t\tWe work hard, we need time to reload and rest. Sometimes we work harder, so we need more. Some times we work less, so we need less.\n\t\t\t\tWe have something called 'life' happening which means we can't work because we have more important stuff to do.\n\t\t\t\tWe want you to take enough rest to reload and recharge so you can be at your prime when working. Taking enough rest is as important as giving it your all when working. The well known on and off switch.\n\t\t\t\tThe concept of work isn't always caught in time (40 hours) and place. Most of the people at Blendle don't keep track of time because time is such a limited variable to grasp the concept of work. There is a balance to strike here and just looking at hours or a holiday quota limits this discussion. \n\t\t\t\tThat is why we don't keep track of holidays.\n\t\t\t\tOur people don't have a holiday quota, but a moral obligation to their loved ones and Blendle to work hard and take enough time to rest. Alright, sounds heavy. How does that work?\n\t\t\t\t'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:\n\t\t\t\tHolidays and national holidays\n\t\t\t\t:\n\t\t\t\t\tYour contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.\n\t\t\t\t\tOn average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).\n\t\t\t\t\tThese rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us. \n\t\t\t\t\tSo here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.\n\t\t\t\t\tYou 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.\n\n\t\t\t\tLife events: \n\t\t\t\t\tLife happens.", "start_char_idx": 23607, "end_char_idx": 27702, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4bfbbf5-4253-4ebb-be90-3707cc32b4d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4bfbbf5-4253-4ebb-be90-3707cc32b4d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d"}, "hash": "1e32d238ed1b5cff0bd4f3ff8efcb7fb30c560f43304f58d422336b5dcbe436c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "35ea3215-0eed-4216-a492-b03174b73d8d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d"}, "hash": "e948ee50e412c646d257f7b832a09228d418e0f508d4fadbb4bb73c1f1b2574c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9025850-aa87-475d-a0c2-dc2ea56c8e6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5ce4657690297144731c757b60a1f1447fc2eb9d205870a9e8f39511d0b7178", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan).

You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.\n\n\t\t\t\tLife events: \n\t\t\t\t\tLife happens. Your cat dies, your car broke, you move to another city, you get married or have kids. Life events which all need your attention. We decided that we are not going to decide for you how much time you \n\t\t\t\t\tget \n\t\t\t\t\tfor certain events. The question is: how much time do you actually \n\t\t\t\t\tneed.\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tMost companies don't give you time off for funerals that are not for immediate relatives. We think we don't need a rule to tell us if that funeral is important for you. So take the time you need.\n\n\n\t\t\tEdge cases\n\t\t\t\tSabbatical: check with HR if you for example have plans to take a very long trip (longer then ~4 weeks).\n\t\t\tWork at Blendle\n\n\t\t\tIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \n\t\t\tjob ads here\n\t\t\t. If you want to be kept in the loop about Blendle, you can sign up for \n\t\t\tour behind the scenes newsletter\n\n\n\t\t\tYou are ill/sick or had an accident and \n\t\t\tcan not work.\n\t\t\tLet your team and your lead know\n\t\t\t that your are sick and when you expect to feel better. If your lead isn't in or on holidays, you can contact HR.\n\t\t\tUpdate everyone\n\t\t\t on how you are feeling if it takes longer then expected. Stay home until you are better.\n\t\t\tLet everyone know\n\t\t\t when you are back.\n\n\t\t\tFYI:\n\t\t\tYour lead calls you in sick with the \n\t\t\tArbo\n\t\t\t,\n\t\t\t which is important for insurance and legal purposes.  \n\t\t\tArbo helps us (you and Blendle) in case we need advice or help. They have counsols and doctors on speed dial if needed, visit our \n\t\t\tArbo page\n\t\t\t for the information.\n\t\t\tIf you call in sick more then 3 times in a year, that is considered above average, so Arbo advises us to check in with you if you are alright. We will.\n\t\t\tDon't feel guilty for being sick. \n\t\t\tGo to the doctor in time if you need to. Don't act tough. \n\t\t\tIf you have weird or vague complaints over a longer period of time like headaches, bad sleep or panic-related stuff. Check your stress level.\n\t\t\tYou want to call or e-mail our direct contact at Arbo directly, you can find the contact details \n\t\t\tright here \n\t\t\t(not public)\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWork at Blendle\n\n\t\t\tIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \n\t\t\tjob ads here\n\t\t\t.

This way we have enough time for the necessary paperwork with UWV. We also need a pregnancy statement from your doctor with the due date.\n\n\t\t\t\tSome practical info:\n\t\t\t\tAbsence during pregnancy:\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you happen to get ill because of your pregnancy or if you have to be absent because of doctor appointments, please inform your lead. Our general guidelines on\n\t\t\t\t\t Holidays\n\t\t\t\t\t and\n\t\t\t\t\t Sickness\n\t\t\t\t\t absence also apply in this case.\n\t\t\t\tSalary:\n\t\t\t\t\tNothing changes here. Blendle pays your full salary.\n\t\t\t\tDuration of maternity leave:\n\t\t\t\t\tBy law you are entitled to 16 weeks of paid maternity leave. And you decide when your leave starts. The leave can start anywhere between 6-4 weeks before your due date. If you are pregnant with twins or more... you can leave between 10-8 weeks before your due date. Please let us know if you encounter unexpected complications during this time. We understand it's not always easy and will do our best to accommodate your situation.\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are a couple more exceptions that can affect your maternity leave. You can either contact HR for more info or \n\t\t\t\t\tvisit the government\u2019s info page.\n\n\t\t\t\tTo-do during pregnancy:\n\t\t\t\tAt least 3 months before your due date:\n\t\t\t\t\tTell your lead and HR that you are pregnant\n\t\t\t\t\tShow your pregnancy statement to HR\n\t\t\t\tAt least 3 weeks before your leave:\n\t\t\t\t\tTogether with your lead, set a date for your leave and inform HR\n\t\t\t\t\tDiscuss possible work-related adjustments with your lead (like parental leave, breastfeeding)\n\t\t\t\tWithin 4 weeks after birth:\n\t\t\t\t\tInform HR of the birth date\n\t\t\t\t\tLet your lead and HR know if you need anything when you are back at work\n\n\t\t\tBirth leave\n\t\t\t\tAs a partner (if you are not the one giving birth) you are also entitled to leave after the birth of your child. The official term for this is birth leave. By law you can take 1 week off to enjoy your new offspring and help your partner. We think that is way too short, so we are adding 3 extra weeks on top of that. So you have the option to take 4 weeks off, but if you don't want to, you do not have to :). During these \n\t\t\t\t4 weeks \n\t\t\t\tyou get your full salary paid. Just make sure you and your lead have made arrangements about the continuity of the ongoing projects/work within your team during your absence.Again, please let us know if you and your partner encounter unexpected complications. We\u2019ll do our best to help where we can.\n\n\t\t\tParental leave\n\t\t\t\tAs a parent (both parents) you are also entitled to parental leave for every child. In total, you can have \n\t\t\t\t26 x your weekly work hours\n\t\t\t\t off per child. If you work 40 hours a week, it would be 1040 hours total parental leave for each child.  So this right applies to each child separately and you can make use of it until a child is 8 years old. You can choose to take time off either for a longer period at once, or spread it. For example 1 day per week off.\n\n\t\t\t\tImportant note\u2192 \n\t\t\t\tYou won't be getting salary and other allowances during the parental leave. And technically, you are not saving up for holiday hours and you are not saving up for holiday allowance.\n\n\t\t\t\tPlease let your lead and HR know if you are planning to take parental leave.

This social code describes what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour when working at Blendle and the steps we will take to restore the values when someone violates them.\n\t\t\tWe were inspired after reading \n\t\t\tthis example from Workable\n\t\t\t and used that as a starting point for this document.\n\n\t\t\tWhy do we need this social code?\n\t\t\tBy setting out our code our goal is to make sure it is crystal clear what is OK and what\u2019s not. It is a starting point for healthy discussions, and we hope to support any feeling of mistreatment with it.\n\n\t\t\tOur social code\n\t\t\tWe expect you to foster a well-organised, respectful and collaborative environment. You should avoid offending, participating in heated altercations and disrupting our workplace. We will not tolerate anyone intimidating, pestering, humiliating, victimizing or sabotaging others at Blendle. We also prohibit wilful discrimination based on age, sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity, race, religion or disability. This is by no means an exhaustive list but it gives an indication, use your common sense. You should also conform to \n\t\t\tour inclusion and diversity policy\n\t\t\t in all aspects of your work, from recruitment and performance reviews to interpersonal relations. In general: \u2018Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\u2019.\n\t\t\tThis code applies to all employees, contractors, public visitors, customers and anyone else at Blendle with whom you come into contact.\n\n\t\t\t\tYou are \n\t\t\t\talways\n\t\t\t\t in charge of the process and can decide how to move forward when you report an incident.

In serious cases like sexual assault, please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges. We acknowledge it\u2019s often hard to come forward about these issues, and we strive to have as many channels of communication open so that whoever you're comfortable talking to, we're here for you. \n\n\t\t\t\tHere are the steps you can take, either:\n\t\t\t\tTalk to the offender\n\t\t\t\t. If you suspect that an offender doesn\u2019t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).\n\t\t\t\tTalk to your team lead\n\t\t\t\t. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.\n\t\t\t\tTalk to HR\n\t\t\t\t. Feel free to reach out to HR in any case of harassment no matter how minor it may seem. For your safety, contact HR as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment (e.g. sexual advances) or if your team lead is involved in your claim. Anything you disclose will remain confidential.\n\t\t\t\tTalk to a confidential counsellor\n\t\t\t\t. If for any reason you don't want to talk to HR or your team lead directly, you can choose to talk to our outside counsellor. We appointed one in November 2018. The outside counsellor can listen to you and advise you on possible next steps. Again, you will always be in the lead on next steps. The content of your conversation will always stay confidential and will not reach Blendle or the offender. You can contact our counsellor directly by \n\t\t\t\temail or phone (not a public link)\n\t\t\t\t.\n\t\t\t\tIf you report assault to the police, Blendle will provide any possible support until the matter is resolved.

While we strongly condemn any form of harassment, we specifically want to give guidance on sexual harassment because it has a big impact on feeling safe, happy and included at Blendle.\n\n\t\t\t\tWe won\u2019t tolerate sexual harassment at Blendle in any shape or form. Our culture is based on mutual respect, responsibility and freedom. Sexual harassment is a serious violation of those principles.\n\n\t\t\t\tSexual harassment can exhaust those who endure it. Speaking up about this issue is often tough for fear of not being heard, upsetting team leads and challenging corporate culture.\n\t\t\t\tPlease don\u2019t let these fears deter you. Blendle will do everything possible to stop sexual harassment and any other kind of harassment from happening, while supporting harassed employees.

Also, if representatives of our contractors or vendors sexually harass our employees, we will demand that the company they work for takes disciplinary action and/or refuse to work with this person in the future.\n\t\t\t\tSexual harassment is never too minor to be dealt with. \n\t\t\t\tAny kind of harassment can wear you down and create a hostile workplace. We will hear every claim and take appropriate disciplinary actions.\n\t\t\t\tSexual harassment is about how we make others feel. \n\t\t\t\tMany do not consider behaviors like flirting or sexual comments to be sexual harassment, thinking they are too innocent to be labeled that way. But, if something you do makes your colleagues uncomfortable, or makes them feel unsafe, you must stop. Whether it is on or off Blendle premises.\n\t\t\t\tWe assume every sexual harassment claim is legitimate unless proven otherwise. \n\t\t\t\tWe listen to victims of sexual harassment and always conduct our investigations properly. Occasional false reports do not undermine this principle.\n\t\t\t\tWe will not allow further victimization of harassed employees. \n\t\t\t\tWe will fully support employees who were sexually harassed and will not take any adverse action against them. For example, we will not move them to positions with worse pay or benefits or allow others to retaliate against them.\n\t\t\t\tThose who support or overlook sexual harassment are as much at fault as offenders. \n\t\t\t\tLeads and HR especially are obliged to prevent sexual harassment and act when they have suspicions or receive reports.

The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle. \n\n\t\t\tDiversity and inclusion at Blendle\n\t\t\tWhat we know now:\n\t\t\tWe believe in the importance of a \n\t\t\tdiverse\n\t\t\t team because we believe \n\t\t\tit's crucial to our succes and product.\n\t\t\t We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.\n\t\t\tWe believe being \n\t\t\tinclusive\n\t\t\t is important because it \n\t\t\tfits our core values \n\t\t\tof wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.\n\t\t\tWe have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the 'pools' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.\n\t\t\tWe have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.\n\n\t\t\tSome observations\n\t\t\t:\n\t\t\tWe tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English. \n\t\t\tThe way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.\n\t\t\tThere is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we're in.\n\t\t\tMost of the leaders at Blendle are male.\n\t\t\tThere is equal pay between men and women in the same role.\n\t\t\tWe believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas. \n\n\t\t\tWhat we do:\n\t\t\tFight bias in hiring. For example by not asking for a resume when people apply, but asking questions related to the actual job. This way the first judgement is based on relevant information, not on age or a picture.\n\t\t\tEmphasize the fact that we would like more diverse profiles to reply on our job postings by adding it to our vacancies. In Dutch: \n\t\t\t\"Niet onbelangrijk: we vinden diversiteit belangrijk, dus laat je alsjeblieft niet tegenhouden om te solliciteren als je anders denkt of er anders uitziet. Dat vinden we juist mooi.\" \n\t\t\tAnd in English:\n\t\t\t \"Final remark: we think it's important to have a diverse workforce, so please don't hesitate to apply if you think or look differently. We actually like that.\"\n\t\t\tTrack the basic data.\n\t\t\tGuard equal pay.\n\t\t\tActively source diverse profiles.\n\t\t\tInternal campaign for speaking English, sources for more diverse pipelines with hiring, make this a recurring topic on the HR agenda.\n\n\t\t\tHomework\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWork at Blendle\n\n\t\t\tIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \n\t\t\tjob ads here\n\t\t\t.

Too much stress. \n\t\t\tWe know this can be a topic.\n\t\t\tSo let\u2019s get this conversation going. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhen working at Blendle, there are a few things you should know. Not to scare you. It is just something to be aware of.\n\t\t\t\t1. Blendle is a startup\n\t\t\t\tBlendle is a startup. Your salary (and all benefits) is paid from money from investors. You (and the people you work with) are part of the solution to the problem we are trying to solve. Time lost or wasted is bad, because it doesn\u2019t bring us closer to the goal: supporting quality journalism. We need money to do so. Finding the right product-market fit (building a freaking beautiful product which the whole world wants to use) and becoming profitable is crucial to reaching the end goal.\n\t\t\t\tWe tend to say to people (imagine a smile on our face): \u2018Hey, but no pressure!\u2019, and then we both start to laugh (or else it is awkward). Well let me say this once, loud and clear: we realise that there is pressure. It can be pretty intense. This is not a regular corporate day job, and that has its up- and downsides. Example upside: we don\u2019t care where and when you work, which means flexibility. Example downside: you have to be able to regulate yourself, which can be hard.\n\t\t\t\tThere are a lot of product/business choices made because of this survival mode. Some you might like (a lot of freedom and responsibility in your work), some you might dislike (pressure on shipping, for example). \n\t\t\t\tBottom line: survival mode results in a fast-paced, high-pressure, sometimes hectic/chaotic environment.\n\t\t\t\tWe trust you to keep this in mind along this rollercoaster ride called Blendle. We trust you to remind your colleagues about this when you feel like they forgot. We trust you to ask questions, always and to anyone. We trust you to spend the money and time you have here as if this were your own startup and you are the entrepreneur.\n\t\t\t\t2. Working at Blendle can be stressful\n\t\t\t\tNow you are aware of the fact that Blendle is in survival mode, you should be aware of how this can impact you. Survival mode will get you on your toes, but you can\u2019t be on your toes 100% of the time. Stress and pressure is good when it pushes you to come up with something no one ever thought of. We need that to succeed. \n\t\t\t\tBut too much or too long stress and pressure is counterproductive.\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tCombine this with an ambitious, driven, perfectionist character and you have a dangerous cocktail. We are all very eager to grow. We'll talk more about this on the page 'What is stress'.\n\t\t\t\tOh and sometimes \u2018life happens\u2019. Life events happen and it affects your state of mind. Don\u2019t underestimate the effect of stuff happening in your life.  Add this to the equation and you might understand why we want to address this.\n\t\t\t\tFor now we\u2019ll use the term stress. Not sure if that covers everything.\n\n\t\t\t\tIn the following pages we\u2019ll talk about what stress is, how you can recognize when there is too much stress, what you can do and what Blendle can do.\n\n\t\t\t\tTL;DR\n\t\t\t\tRead \n\t\t\t\thttp://firstround.com/review/practical-frameworks-for-beating-burnout/\n\t\t\t\tBe aware of your stress level and work-life balance (use the checklists/self test)\n\t\t\t\tBe aware of the stress level and work-life balance of your colleagues and speak up.\n\t\t\t\tAct: change your schedule, take time off, rethink your role and talk about it.\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue reading, start finding out what stress is\n\t\t\t\t >>\n\n\t\t\t\tWork at Blendle\n\n\t\t\t\tIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \n\t\t\t\tjob ads here\n\t\t\t\t.

It all starts between your ears: yup, your brain. On a real basic (biological) level, your brain reacts to situations by unleashing certain substances in your head and body. These substances make your body ready for\n\t\t\t\t fight or flight\n\t\t\t\t. This system is great when you for example need to run from a lion or bear. Your body and mind go into survival mode, giving you extra strength, extra endurance and extra focus. \n\t\t\t\tBack in the day, it was a great way to survive.\n\n\t\t\t\tWe call this the fight-or-flight response, and while this once incredibly important response was evolutionarily adaptive, it is now maladaptive. We don\u2019t live in that same world anymore where it made so much sense. We aren\u2019t being chased down by lions or being eaten by wolves while sitting in front of our computers in our air-conditioned offices, and yet our fight-or-flight responses are still being activated.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNowadays this system is still triggered from time to time, helping you 'survive', but in a slightly different way. At Blendle this system can come in handy when working towards a launch, finishing a feature, picking the best stories, making angry users happy or doing that crucial presentation to get that big ass partnership. At Blendle you will face these moments more than in an average company. This is not only because Blendle is in survival mode, but also because your work carries weight. It matters. In a lot of situations you are solely responsible for a very impactful decision or call. \n\t\t\t\tThe stress system will help you perform and get better\n\t\t\t\t. But, there is a big but. Every time you use this system (on purpose or not), you need time to recover and reload.\n\t\t\t\tToo much of this stress system will drain you\n\t\t\t\t and eventually burn you out.

But this is to give you a grasp of how it feels when it\u2019s been too much.\n\n\t\t\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s not just having too much to do, it\u2019s having committed to doing more than you know you have time for.

Then they\u2019re hard on themselves for not getting perfect marks in every category. As soon as they meet their own bar, they raise it.\u201d\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAlright, so here we are: we now know we have a potentially dangerous environment (startup, fast paced, a lot of changes, a lot of freedom, not always clear structure) and we attract certain type of people: responsible, perfectionist, driven, ambitious and hard on themselves.\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tWhat can we do?\n\t\t\t\t >>>\n\t\t\t\tYes, we can do something about it :)!\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWork at Blendle\n\n\t\t\t\tIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \n\t\t\t\tjob ads here\n\t\t\t\t.

This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn\u2019t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).\n\t\t\t\t\tOnce you feel reloaded, we (you, teamlead and HR if you like) need to talk about the factors that caused your stress level to rise and see how we can prevent this from happening again.\n\t\t\t\tI\u2019m not good.

They know Blendle and the environment and they will be able to get you back on track. Our advice would be to talk to us first, but if you feel you can\u2019t do that for whatever reason: contact Martijn ten Bokum from Arbobutler: m.ten.bokum@arbobutler.nl.\n\t\t\t\t\tDepending on your case and your problems, we (together with the people from Arbobutler) come up with a tailor made plan, based on what you need. This could involve some time off, working less or talking to a job coach.\n\n\t\t\t\t2. Be aware\n\n\t\t\t\tYou can start with dividing your life into different parts. Think of: family, work, colleagues, sports, hobby, voluntary work. Once you have a clear overview of all the different areas, think about whether it adds to your stress level and if there are ways to change things. Let's zoom in a bit further:\n\n\t\t\t\tPrivate life\n\t\t\t\tMaybe you are in the middle of moving into your dream house or you are trying to get your house sold. Maybe you become a mom or dad, or maybe you really want to. Maybe you just got married or you just went through a rough break up. Maybe you have a lot of debts which are hard to get rid off. Maybe you have an addiction you are struggling with. Maybe you lost someone you love. Whatever it is: it affects your meter and it adds up.\n\t\t\t\tMapping this out and being aware of this already helps. When becoming aware of a big thing which adds to our stress level, we can see if we can try to fix it. This will not work for everything \u2014 of course, life sucks sometimes. But when in the midst of moving to another house, why not take 2 weeks off and really get it done instead of doing it beside your demanding job? Even the harder obstacles can be worked on. Start by going to the doctor, marriage counseling or a psychologist. It won\u2019t \u2018fix\u2019 the problem instantly of course, but it\u2019s a start. And again: sometimes life sucks.\n\n\t\t\t\tBlendle life\n\t\t\t\tWorking at a startup in survival mode (shifting directions, runway, fixing the product, changing teams)\n\t\t\t\tYour personal development (new role, changing responsibilities, not a set-in-stone job description)\n\t\t\t\tEverything happening around you (people leaving and joining, people taking on new responsibilities, changing PM\u2019s and teamleads).\n\t\t\t\tWe know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.\n\t\t\t\tAnd also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let\u2019s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure?

Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let\u2019s try to fix it or at least talk about it.\n\t\t\t\tBlendle cares. We care. So if you\u2019re struggling, let\u2019s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.\n\n\t\t\t\t3. Make changes: here are some quick wins\n\t\t\t\tLook at your work life balance\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there\u2019s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we\u2019re being very clever. We\u2019re not. We think we can work long hours \u2014 month after month, year after year \u2014 and that there won\u2019t be any wear and tear. But there is.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYes, as we now know there is a lot more to it than just taking holidays and working less. You could still feel stressed working 20 hours. Looking at the time spent on work and time spent on your personal life is a pretty good start and good for everybody (also when you don\u2019t feel stressed. Let\u2019s try to prevent it).\n\t\t\t\tTake freedom and responsibility: find the right rhythm\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWe are a company with flexible working hours. This freedom comes with a responsibility. When we say that, a lot of people assume that they need to work a lot and really hard in exchange for that freedom. That is not what we are trying to say.\n\t\t\t\t\tYou have the responsibility to find out what rhythm works for you best, to be at your best. \n\t\t\t\t\tSimply because we believe not everybody works the same way. So do you have the rhythm which works best for you? We want everybody to be able to bring their child, cat or car to daycare. Not because we love cats in particular (yes we do), but we want nothing to get in your way of getting the most out of your day. The fact that we don\u2019t care when and how many times you go to a doctor, psych or barber is not because we want to be the \u2018cool employer\u2019, but because you need your health to add value that day. So if that means visiting the barber once a week on Monday morning: please do.\n\t\t\t\t\tSo have you found your rhythm yet? Rolo hates traffic jams so you\u2019ll see him coming and going at exotic times. Alex is scrolling through his Twitter feed till late at night so you won't see him before 11:00 at the office. Rick\u2019s alarm clock is set at 6:00 and we know he doesn\u2019t snooze, so he\u2019s in at 8:00, leaving early to have dinner with his wife.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt might help announcing changes in your rythm to your team. It makes it feel legit for you, and your team members can help you with it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time. \n\t\t\t\t\tIt hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it\u2019s okay, You\u2019re not working in a factory with time stamps.\n\t\t\t\t\tBe flexible. Some days you just don\u2019t have it. \n\t\t\t\t\tYou are not a machine.\n\t\t\t\t\t Of course, first you\u2019ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn\u2019t work it\u2019s okay.

Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.\n\t\t\t\t\tRotate, change your pace.\n\t\t\t\t\t During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.\n\t\t\t\tTake care of your body and mind\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTake holidays and days off.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis one seems obvious, but we know it\u2019s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it\u2019s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It\u2019s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don\u2019t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.\n\t\t\t\t\tDon\u2019t work when you\u2019re sick\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don\u2019t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.\n\t\t\t\t\tFood and exercise\n\t\t\t\t\tCrucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn\u2019t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn\u2019t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen something is wrong: go see a doctor:\n\t\t\t\t\tDon\u2019t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It\u2019s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.\n\t\t\t\tSetting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou, your family, friends and loved ones\n\t\t\t\t\tBlendle\n\t\t\t\t\tIt\u2019s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order.

The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.\n\t\t\t\tSo what can Blendle do?\n\n\t\t\t\tVoicing vision & mission more:\n\t\t\t\t everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.\n\t\t\t\tOpen channels:\n\t\t\t\t work on transparency and trust\n\t\t\t\t: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren\u2019t in the right role or simply doing work they don\u2019t love everyday.\n\t\t\t\tBuild an environment which is less stressful.\n\t\t\t\t This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let\u2019s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it\u2019s too much.\n\t\t\t\tKeep jobs fun:\n\t\t\t\t Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let\u2019s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.\n\t\t\t\tEducate: \n\t\t\t\twe should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn\u2019t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.\n\t\t\t\tFeedback and praise: \n\t\t\t\tkeep working on the feedback cycle and don\u2019t forget to include praise. Let\u2019s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.\n\t\t\t\tCreate awareness\n\t\t\t\t within teams and team leads:\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you giving regular feedback?\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you giving praise?\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you actively challenging your team?\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?\n\t\t\t\t\tAre you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?\n\t\t\t\t\tIs your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.\n\t\t\t\t\tIs your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?\n\t\t\t\t\tHere\u2019s an article about how to help your team with this: \n\n\t\t\t\tLook out for each other: \n\t\t\t\tthere is no official peer program (not yet), so we have to look out for each other. Ask each other questions and be candid to each other if you hear red flags.\n\t\t\t\tHiring\n\t\t\t\t: we should keep hiring great, talented people who will give us energy, ideas and of course are fun to work with.\n\n\t\t\t\tThat\u2019s it folks. Let\u2019s get this conversation going.\n\t\t\t\tIf you are struggling with this now (try the self test) and you recognize the symptoms you might have read in the articles: let us know.

And of course, whether you're at the office or somewhere else,\u00a0be sure to lock your computer whenever you are AFK. And whenever you hear \u201cBrace, Brace!\u201d, be sure to get yourself into brace-position.

We still have a lot of vacancies open\u2026 but apart from them, we\u2019re always looking for new recruits. So, do you know anyone fitting the (or a) profile? Let them know we\u2019re looking for \u2018em or let HR know they need to contact them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBusiness intelligence\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSounds cool. It is. We want everybody to be informed and make the best decisions possible because all the intel is available. This is also a great way to be transparant.

Drive and fit are the same for everyone. Work is specified per role or discipline.\n\t\t\tPer area (work, drive, fit), we came up with really concrete traits (skills, knowledge or behavior). This covers roughly 80%, so feel free to use traits that are not on this list. \n\t\t\tWe defined what progress would look like on that specific trait. This isn\u2019t a way of defining seniority per se, you can be a \u2018level 3\u2019 on one point and \u2018level 1\u2019 on the other.\n\t\t\tThis will help you to know where you stand in a certain area and it\u2019s now easier to define the steps you can take to improve this.\n\t\t\tFor example: If you got the feedback that drive is something you can work on, you are now able to make it more specific by looking at what drive actually means. Is it in the area of \u2018Speed = habit and flexible\u2019 or is it about \u2018self regulation\u2019?\n\t\t\tWe think it will help, but please let me know if that is the case. Really this is up for debate and it should help us get to the overall goals faster. So play around with it and let me know what you think.\n\n\t\t\tWhat?\n\t\t\tAs said we came up with 3 categories: \n\t\t\twork, drive and fit.\n\t\t\t We also use these categories during the hiring process. It's not perfect but it helps us review ourselves and our colleagues. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that we also use it during the feedback cycle. In the beginning of 2017 we started writing down what we think work, drive and fit entail. \n\t\t\tWork \n\t\t\tis specified per role or expertise. It should cover ~80% of the tasks, skills, knowledge and responsibilities. \n\t\t\tDrive\n\t\t\t and \n\t\t\tFit\n\t\t\t are the same for everyone for now. Drive is about grit, motivation, eagerness, proactiveness, a way of working and a certain mentality and mindset. Fit is about your DNA matching Blendle's DNA and actively working on keeping that match so we stay aligned.\n\t\t\tTo help people grow, we pinned down what we believe growth would look like in a specific area or trait. This will help with giving, receiving and processing feedback. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWork at Blendle\n\n\t\t\tIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \n\t\t\tjob ads here\n\t\t\t.

Everyone in the hiring process is biased and therefore the ratings are too. So no exact science here.\n\n\t\t\t1, 2 or 3\n\t\t\t\tWe chose a 3 point scale. This could also be a 5+ point scale, but we noticed more options doesn't make it easier. \n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t: Poor\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t: Acceptable\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t: Good\n\t\t\t\tNotice how a \n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t is a positive and not a neutral score, but three 2's is probably not enough. More on that later on.\n\t\t\tWork, Drive and Fit.\n\t\t\t\tDuring the process we score people on:\n\t\t\t\tNote: this doesn't cover everything, but it's a good start. We tried to keep it simple.\n\t\t\t\tWork:\n\t\t\t\t how good is our candidate at his/her job?\n\t\t\t\tDrive:\n\t\t\t\t how driven and intrinsically motivated is our candidate?\n\t\t\t\tFit:\n\t\t\t\t how well does our candidate match with Blendle as a company and the team?\n\t\t\t\tWant to know what work, drive and fit really entails: go the the \n\t\t\t\tMatrix\u2122\n\t\t\t\t and get inspired.\n\t\t\t\tAt the beginning of the hiring process, the hiring manager and hiring team draw up a profile, also based on work, drive and fit and the matrix. That profile is your blueprint and that's also your yardstick for your ratings. Rating the coding skills of a lead iOS developer is different from rating someone who still has a lot to learn, so what we are looking for determines how we rate. Hope that makes sense :).\n\t\t\tHow do you rate?\n\t\t\t\tFierce but fair:\n\t\t\t\t be critical. It's important that the whole hiring team does this so the process isn't skewed.\n\t\t\t\tWith arguments: \n\t\t\t\tthe rating has to have a foundation. This is really important when it comes to a decision. If you don't have any, don't give a rating. Just keep in mind that this means you missed a spot in your interview or part of the process. You didn't get the information you needed to give a rating, but that is why you are involved in the process.\n\t\t\t\tAlone:\n\t\t\t\t you rate by yourself. Try not to influence each other too much by already talking to each other before rating. Sounds a bit 'high-school-ish' but even a 'this is really good' already primes your mind in a way. People like to agree ;).\n\t\t\t\tImmediate:\n\t\t\t\t after every step in the process, rate immediately. Write your thoughts and rating down somewhere. \n\t\t\t\tThrough the process:\n\t\t\t\t How your thoughts evolve through the process is also really valuable information. For example: based on the Github profile, you think someone is not really good at - let's say - testing, so you give a 1 on Work because we decided that this is important for us. You can embed this in the assignment and pair day and actively look for someone's testing skills to check the 1 you gave at first.  \n\t\t\tThe rating process.\n\t\t\t\tSo you rate continuously throughout the process.\n\t\t\t\tAt every crossroad during the process, you use your ratings to make a decision.\n\t\t\t\tSo take another look at the whole \n\t\t\t\thiring process\n\t\t\t\t.\n\n\t\t\t\tAfter every step you have a decision to make: turn down or take next step.

Seniority counts, sure. But it's important to \n\t\t\t\t\tweigh up everyone's opinion\n\t\t\t\t\t. Ask each other questions if you feel like not everybody is speaking up.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe hiring manager has the last say and will lead the discussion. \n\t\t\t\t\tIf you continue to disagree, try asking a \n\t\t\t\t\tthird party\n\t\t\t\t\t to the table (HR/Rick/Alex) to moderate the discussion. \n\t\t\t\t\tIf you are 80% sure, that's a good score. It's impossible to know everything based on a resume, an assignment and an interview.\n\t\t\t\t\tAlways take a look at the original profile from when you started your hunt for a new colleague. Does this person check all the boxes? Where did we compromise?

Feel free to do so, that's the point :). \n\t\t\t\tLook at the original profile\n\t\t\t\t\tSo what were you originally looking for? A very important question before you make your final decision.\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\n\t\t\tWork at Blendle\n\n\t\t\tIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \n\t\t\tjob ads here\n\t\t\t. If you want to be kept in the loop about Blendle, you can sign up for \n\t\t\tour behind the scenes newsletter\n\t\t\t.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe days of post and pray (put out a job ad and wait for people to apply) are over and we believe that is a good thing. Sure, we still put our vacancies online so people know we are hiring, but that is only the first part of our plan of attack. Let's dig in!\n\t\t\t1. Job posting\n\t\t\tGoal: get word out that we're hiring for a specific role and have something to refer to.\n\t\t\tWe post our vacancies on our job page, available in Dutch and English:\n\n\t\t\tHR is admin and updates pictures and copy on the overall page. If you have suggestions, please poke them. \n\t\t\tThe hiring manager is responsible for the vacancy and job description.\n\t\t\tIf you want to create a new job\n\t\t\t, duplicate the template (all the way down), rename it and put it on private. You can edit the job by clicking the pencil button.\n\t\t\t2. Branding\n\t\t\tGoal: long term brand building.\n\t\t\tAt Blendle we are pretty good at positioning ourselves as a company that knows what they are doing. That\u2019s no coincidence: most of the time we do and we have a lot of smart people working here. That\u2019s the basis of course. But to give that image a hand, think about the following things:\n\t\t\tWrite a blog about a cool project you did\n\t\t\tShare/open source pieces of your work for others to use\n\t\t\tShow your face at meetups, try to do a talk every once in a while.\n\t\t\tStay up to date: don\u2019t forget to invest in reading/listening/watching stuff going on in your field. When sharing something cool you learned by looking at new things: +1!\n\n\t\t\t#achterdeschermen\n\t\t\tGoal: brand building and keeping potentially interested people up to date.\n\t\t\tIn 2016 we sent our first #achterdeschermen or #behindthescenes newsletter. The idea came from the fact that we had a lot of visitors to our job website who didn't apply. So they were interested, but saw nothing relevant for them. To make sure we stay in touch with this group we added this to our job site:\n\t\t\t\"Not looking for a job, but just interested in Blendle? Click \n\t\t\there\n\t\t\t, and we'll keep you posted.\"\n\t\t\tThis link brings you to a simple sign up page. \n\t\t\tApart from sending a newsletter every now and then and sharing it via twitter, we did nothing to grow this group. And yet we have almost 900 sign ups today and still growing every week. \n\t\t\tIt's a very straightforward summary or overview of what's going on at Blendle. Sjamilla shared one via medium once: \n\n\n\t\t\tAlways be selling. \n\t\t\tThere is a potential applicant in everyone we meet. Even if it's not them, their neighbour, friend or relative might be interested. \n\t\t\tThis way, we get high quality frontend applicants who send us an application.\n\n\t\t\tI really like how he mentions we got stuck in his head, in a positive way. That's the goal.\n\n\t\t\t3.

That's the goal.\n\n\t\t\t3. Sourcing\n\t\t\tGoal: both short and long term. Get people in who are a match according to us. \n\t\t\tSourcing is our most important way to get people in. Sourcing is every way of proactively asking people - who we find interesting - if they are interested in working with us. This mainly happens online and can really be an art. The days of just Linkedin inmails are over, we have to be more creative.\n\t\t\tImportant:\n\t\t\t We only use candidate info that is publicly available when sourcing. If we reach out to candidates we mention where we found them and where we got there contact info. We rely on legit interest when we reach out, but delete all data when a candidate is unresponsive or not interested. We only source candidates after a hiring team reviewed the profile, so reaching out is always a serious invitation for a cup of coffee.\n\t\t\tSourcing is practically always part of the hiring strategy because it's the fastest way to get quality people in. Some pointers:\n\t\t\tDo it for every job. \n\t\t\tAlso for jobs that get a lot of applicants (like the editorial positions). We recommend everybody to use sourcing.\n\t\t\tSource to pin down your profile. \n\t\t\tNew roles can be hard to pin down in a few bullet points. Since we can only hire (or turn down) someone if we know exactly what we are looking for, sourcing can be a good addition. You make a list of 20 people who match your profile so far on paper, aks your top 5 if they would like to have a cup of coffee with you. Use those conversations to finish your profile.\n\t\t\tAlways start with sourcing.\n\t\t\t Mainly because it takes time and it takes more steps than an applicant who is ready to go. So don't wait until you notice you don't have enough good people coming in. Start with it. \n\n\t\t\tHow\n\t\t\tAs said, sourcing is an art. So leave the black belt sourcing hacking shizzle to Sjamilla. She will help and advise you in the process. What you can do now is think about these different groups and ask yourself if you know (or know people who know) good people.\n\t\t\tChannels\n\t\t\tNetwork\n\t\t\t\tThe fastest and best hires come from our network. From people you know, who know people (who know people\u2026). You get it ;). Also actively ask people you think are great to share the job post or intro a few people that would be a good match.\n\t\t\tCommunity\n\t\t\t\tThis might look the same as your network but it isn\u2019t. Everybody is part of different types of community. Private communities: church, scouting, soccer, Ingress, chessclub, WOW, forums. Or work communities: meet-ups, drinks, conventions or studies. This can be online and offline.\n\t\t\t\tTo do:\n\t\t\t\tMap out your own communities and pick a few where you feel relevant people might be walking around. Try posting the job there in some way.\n\t\t\t\tTry to map out communities your perfect candidate might be a part of. So is there is a big data convention coming up, big chance there might be data people there, let\u2019s see what we can do to get their attention. Post a job, do a talk.\n\t\t\tFormer applicants\n\t\t\t\tPeople change and learn. Go through the list of former applicants and see if there is someone there who might be interesting now. Check the notes or ask someone who spoke to him/her earlier to make sure you invite someone interesting.\n\t\t\t\tFormer applicants are potential fans and a good network to have. They showed interest in Blendle and a job here, so they might tip others to do so too if we play our cards right. Always be good to every applicant and you\u2019ll see you can even ask them if they know anybody who might fit the role.\n\t\t\tEx employees\n\t\t\t\tWe have a pretty good relationship with people who left Blendle. Think about ex employees from Blendle (or your former job) and consider approaching them to ask them if they know someone. The upside is that they know what it takes. Be careful of course, there can be a good reason why someone isn\u2019t working at Blendle anymore.\n\t\t\t\tAlso consider asking if they would like the job themselves. #rehiring.", "start_char_idx": 125098, "end_char_idx": 129382, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fb09c18-1646-4e72-b44a-64092bfb59d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fb09c18-1646-4e72-b44a-64092bfb59d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d"}, "hash": "1e32d238ed1b5cff0bd4f3ff8efcb7fb30c560f43304f58d422336b5dcbe436c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "25bc6d2b-7b01-49d6-819d-f1c960b58449", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d"}, "hash": "a802b25c9df34712318f1121595c4e41a174dbff66070d706d7e8fb88342f361", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a7d24919-c1d1-4dc2-af80-13c21f32bc14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a160487bdd3a829177d4890c2d5e25a6f1b1120d7fa2c07f4cf906fa37c40fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Check the notes or ask someone who spoke to him/her earlier to make sure you invite someone interesting.\n\t\t\t\tFormer applicants are potential fans and a good network to have.

For the migration and relocation part, Blendle works with \n\t\t\tExpat Management Group\n\t\t\t. EMG has a dedicated team involved for the coordination and assistance in immigration, relocation and tax services.\n\t\t\tBlendle Relocation package\n\t\t\tWe take care of the work- and residence permits and all the fees (children and spouse included).\n\t\t\tWe book the flight(s) to the Netherlands.\n\t\t\tWe pay an extra relocation fee to help with the extra expenses.\n\t\t\tWe arrange and pay for the first month of temporary accommodation.\n\t\t\tWe assist with permanent housing. Like helping with the search, negotiations and settling in.\n\t\t\tWe assist with the 30% ruling tax application.\n\n\t\t\tWhat we offer is flexible and can be adjusted to certain personal needs. But we highly recommend to stick with this all-in-one package to reduce any hassle and stress when relocating to the Netherlands.\n\n\t\t\tWhere to start\n\t\t\tWe can basically hire anyone from anywhere in the world. But the migration and relocation procedure will be different for some countries. It's good to know that the migration procedure and relocation can take up to 8 weeks.

Kick off meeting with all team leads by Team HR.\n\t\t\t\t\tTeam HR will schedule a meeting with all leads in the first week to go over new stuff, refresh our feedback memories, answer questions and discuss worry points.\n\t\t\t\t2. Self review, send out peer reviews and check if all your team members did the same.\n\t\t\t\t\tTeam HR blocks time in everyone's agenda. \n\t\t\t\t\tLead by example\n\t\t\t\t\t and make sure you did your own review on time and try to actively stimulate your team members and peers to do the same.\n\t\t\t\t\tCheck in with your team members \n\t\t\t\t\tto see if they have questions. Keep in mind that all formats are just formats and a means to an end. Don't get hung up over semantics or form, feel free to freewheel if you think it's serves the overall goal.\n\n\t\t\t\t3. Write peer reviews and check if team members did the same.\n\t\t\t\t\tManage your time:\n\t\t\t\t\t you will get invites and you have to make reviews for your team. Keep that in mind and feel free to decline requests if you have too much on your plate. You can also just quickly write something in 5 bullets if you get too many requests. \n\t\t\t\t\tWrite reviews for your team members:\n\t\t\t\t\t they can (probably will) invite you, but you can also proactively write a review for them.

Plan and prepare your own review with your lead.\n\t\t\t\t\tSchedule a meeting with your lead first (also before the other reviews). \n\t\t\t\t\tBlock time to prepare.\n\t\t\t\t5. Plan and start preparing reviews with your team members.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe recommend blocking a day or two half days and doing your reviews back to back. Make sure you plan enough time between so you have time to prepare. \n\t\t\t\t\tIf you are in a situation where you have a 2nd seat, you are in charge of the planning, just check with the 2nd seat for his/her availability.\n\t\t\t\tWeek 3 and 4: It's all about execution\n\t\t\t\t1.

Anyone missing? If you already notice that there isn't enough valuable input, consider flagging it with the team member.\n\t\t\t\t\tDo you see anything standing out in the reviews? Think about following up on this with the specific peers.\n\t\t\t\t3.

I also wrote that down and project X where you did ABC is a really good example of it, do you recognize that?\u2019\n\t\t\t\t\tLook for overall themes (bigger points) in the feedback\n\t\t\t\t\t. Try not to dig too deep into the details of concrete projects, feedback or tasks. Use the concrete stuff as an example to make a bigger point. Try to look for bigger points or themes across the concrete feedback. The so-called 'red thread'. Embed this in your questioning. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso, try to dig a bit deeper by asking questions and not taking an easy answer (without going all Freud on someone). Here are a few tips:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t short follow-up questions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExamples:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy is that? How do you feel about that? When did that happen before? How does that work? What did you do? What could you have done? Can you give an example? Can you explain? What stands out for you? Were there things you disagreed with? Which one? How come? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsk neutral questions, without suggestion. So don't include the answer you think or hope you are going to get. Example: 'Did that make you feel stressed?' is less effective than 'How did you feel?'. Unless you specifically want to know someone's stress level, in which case you can use the next tip: ratings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse ratings\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t to get a better understanding. Example: on a scale of 1 to 10, how happy are you with your current role? Or how would you rate your current stress level?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse silence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t It's time to think. Try keeping your mouth shut when silence occurs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tListen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Again: keep that mouth shut and practice the art of listening. Don't bother about the next question or that one thing you want to say. You are well prepared, you'll get your points across. Start with really listening to what someone was to say. You can use paraphrasing for this, but it tends to get annoying hearing 'So if I understand you correctly you mean ...' for the third time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBe curious and eager to understand. Just be human and use your sincere interest in that other person to really understand what someone is saying or maybe not saying.\n\t\t\t\t\tAsk for feedback\n\t\t\t\t\t, how someone is feeling (stress level, work-life balance) and check overall happiness. Try asking about Blendle-wide stuff. For example how they feel about the current direction of the company and how they think you or the other leads are doing.\n\t\t\t\t\tGo meta: you will know when you feel like you scratched the surface.", "start_char_idx": 142366, "end_char_idx": 146608, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07301322-6e78-402a-ab6b-27c199ff7229": {"__data__": {"id_": "07301322-6e78-402a-ab6b-27c199ff7229", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d"}, "hash": "1e32d238ed1b5cff0bd4f3ff8efcb7fb30c560f43304f58d422336b5dcbe436c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "754c82f1-4a0c-4166-9e5b-23e8682aa4ee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "491ea0f6b03147bb8dbc78d5ba6d058d"}, "hash": "a3bf858a94d2d08ad808dcb5b7691668f4b40882b3c225b5a6936dfbf0bc2373", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c228bde-297c-4f2f-97dc-4337659e0807", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9f662b246f5ecc7d2a45d5fb081c56837105399bc648e2c6d7e96e426afb466", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Listen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Again: keep that mouth shut and practice the art of listening.

This results in people having roles which cover multiple disciplines. Keep that in mind when using the matrix for an individual. You can also use other disciplines as an inspiration.\n\t\t\t\tThe \n\t\t\t\tlevels aren't seniority levels\n\t\t\t\t, so keep that in mind. There is a correlation of course. The more level 3 traits someone masters, the more senior someone probably will be.\n\t\t\t\tUse it as\n\t\t\t\t a yardstick.\n\t\t\t\t Think about where you think someone should be on certain traits based on their level of experience and age and use it as an individual yardstick. Make sure you both agree on that level of expectation for that person together and agree on what the biggest improvement points are and how to improve them. \n\t\t\t\tPersonalise.\n\t\t\t\t In the end, we would love the have a tailor-made matrix for everyone, but this will do for now.

Available here, let us know if you'd like to read this and we can order it for you.\n\n\n\t\t\tGive input and flag\n\t\t\t\tYou are the gatekeeper for the performance and development of your team members. If people excel, we should reward them. If someone is underperforming we should look for solutions. We want you to flag both situations with the MT and the HR team. First step is to tell the team member yourself, but keep 'the rest' in the loop too. \n\t\t\t\tDon't wait for a review cycle or contract which expires to give this a thought.\n\t\t\tOptional: \n\t\t\tSkip level session and upward feedback\n\t\t\t\tSkip level session: \n\t\t\t\tAlso called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords. \n\t\t\t\t\u201cIf you\u2019re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,\u201d Scott says. But she\u2019s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting \u2014 commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'\n\t\t\t\tThe process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you\u2019ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager \u2014 and that the meeting is not for attribution.\n\t\t\t\t\u201cIn other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,\u201d says Scott. \u201cIf there were too many things the team didn\u2019t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn\u2019t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.\u201d\n\n\t\t\t\tJust let us know if you would like one and we will organize it for you :).\n\n\t\t\t\tUpward feedback\n\t\t\t\tSomething you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:\n\n\t\t\t\tMy teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.\n\t\t\t\tMy teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).\n\t\t\t\tMy teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.\n\t\t\t\tMy teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.\n\t\t\t\tMy teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.\n\t\t\t\tMy teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR\u2019s.\n\n\t\t\tSome good reads:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWith a great example attached: \n\t\t\thttps://cdn.filestackcontent.com/SS7xTRITymhxGQQ37eaY\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWork at Blendle\n\n\t\t\tIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our \n\t\t\tjob ads here\n\t\t\t.

If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don't want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make. \n\n\t\t\t\tClassic figures: \n\t\t\t\texperience, education, specific knowledge and expertise. \n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag. \n\t\t\t\tScarcity & market value.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's fair to say that it's harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.\n\t\t\t\tRole and responsibilities.\n\t\t\t\t\tCertain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.\n\t\t\t\tActual impact and contribution\n\t\t\t\t\tSince we don't really like job titles, it's good to look at someone's actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?\n\t\t\t\tSomeone's starting point\n\t\t\t\t\tIf we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.\n\t\t\t\tNote: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.\n\t\t\tWhen do we talk about money?\n\t\t\t\t1. \n\t\t\t\tYearly company wide salary raises in January\n\t\t\t\t\tEvery year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don't have a constant conversation about money through the year. We don't think a contract renewal (which is basically just paperwork) should be the moment to talk about money. Mainly because you don't want people to say: give me X or I walk. People can quit any time they want and bring up salary any moment they want, just not as a tactic combined with renewing a contract.  \n\n\t\t\t\t2. \n\t\t\t\tColleague brings it up her/himself\n\t\t\t\t\tWe don't want people to be unhappy about something stupid like money, so we want people to tell us if they are unhappy with their pay. We take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high). We do ask people to come with arguments so we can have an actual talk. More than just: I want more money.

The reward is huge, when you see the people you hired adding value to the company. Imagine not hiring that person: that new idea, design, piece of code, algorithm or audio show would not have been there. Your hire could be key to the succes of Blendle: that's a lot of impact. The other side of the same coin is that it's high effort too. These 4 pointers will help you get started. \n\n\t\t\tPersonnel planning\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tPlanning the number and type of people you need in the future is hard but also crucial. Hiring people takes time (~3 months), so looking ahead is important for making your projects succeed. Without the right (number of) people, it's hard to build a cool product.\n\t\t\t\tWhen making plans for \n\t\t\t\tthe coming and next quarter:\n\t\t\t\t\tDetermine what work needs to be done, looking 3-6 months ahead, and decide if we have enough resources to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tOur basic premise is that we work with the team we have and we hire reactively. But ask yourself a few questions. Do you have the right number and type of people? What kind of skills, expertise, experience do you need in what amount? What can we fix internally? What can we teach the people who are at Blendle? What can we just try with advice from outside? Is your ask temporary or permanent? How is the current workload? Can we afford to ship less quickly? \n\t\t\t\t\tKeep teams small. \n\t\t\t\t\tMore then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better.

The next step is to pin down what you are (and aren't) exactly looking for in a candidate. This step is crucial. Rush this and you'll find yourself wobbling further down the road. \n\t\t\t\tAsk for help from recruitment/HR with this. They can help you out.\n\t\t\t\tThis set of questions should help you define your perfect candidate.\n\t\t\t\tWhat team will the new person be joining? What is the goal of that team and how does that new person's job fit in there?\n\t\t\t\tWhat problems are we aiming to solve by hiring this person?

What do you expect from him/her?\n\t\t\t\tWhat challenges or downsides does this role have? \n\t\t\t\tWhat would you call the role? Is it an existing role (if yes: think if you can use someone as a blueprint, if no: make sure to check if our job title matches with other companies).\n\t\t\t\tHow much experience do you think this person needs? What kind and type of experience? In what kind and type of environments? Do you expect this person to be plug and play or is there room for learning and growing?\n\t\t\t\tWhat could someone's career path look like at Blendle? What do we have to offer there?\n\t\t\t\tDo you expect this person to lead a team or guild in a way?\n\t\t\t\tWhat would a average week look like for this person?\n\t\t\t\tWhat are examples of projects that were there the last quarter which could have been done by the new hire? What projects or topics are coming up?\n\t\t\t\tWhat kind of skills, knowledge, expertise or experience does this person need? Make a distinction between must-haves and nice-to-haves. Be specific.\n\t\t\t\tWhat kind of skills are lacking in the current team which this new person should bring?\n\t\t\t\tSelling points: why would someone quit his job for this role? Think about the team, the role and Blendle.\n\t\t\t\tShare this with the hiring team, so everybody is on the same page on what we are looking for.\n\n\t\t\t\tWhen pinning down the profile, keep \n\t\t\t\tthe Matrix\u2122\n\t\t\t\t and Work, Drive and Fit in mind. That's also what your hiring team is going to rate the candidates on, so it's good to know what they have to be rating.\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tIf it's a new role, it can be hard to pin these questions down. You can use this set of questions to ask experts in the field to help you pin down the profile as described in the section '\n\t\t\t\tGetting people in'\n\t\t\t\t section 3: Sourcing:\n\t\t\t\tSource to pin down your profile. New roles can be hard to pin down in a few bullet points. Since we can only hire (or turn down) someone if we know exactly what we are looking for, sourcing can be a good addition. Make a list of 20 people who match your profile so far on paper, ask your top 5 if they would like to have a cup of coffee with you. Use those conversations to finish your profile.\n\t\t\tFinish job description & get started\n\t\t\t\tGo to \n\t\t\t\tadmin.homerun.co\n\t\t\t\t and log in with your google account from Blendle.\n\t\t\t\tAsk HR to duplicate a template for you and make you hiring manager or reuse an existing job description and go from there. \n\t\t\t\tGo to edit:\n\n\t\t\t\tAdjust the job description to your liking:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first section is about the team, what they do and the reason why we are hiring.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe second section consists of the 4-5 reasons we chose to work at Blendle.

During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you'll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person too in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt.

This should scare the bejeezus out of you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYears of interviewing experience and research taught us a few things. Embed these pointers in your interviewing and you'll notice right away. No-good money back.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tStructured interviews\n\t\t\t\t\t vs. winging it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn unstructured interview (winging it) is a very poor way of gathering information for a hiring decision. You should approach this talk with a strategy. What are you hoping to get out of the meeting and how are you going to get it?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt starts at the moment you and your team decided to hire someone. That's the point you come up with a solid profile, with both hard, concrete as soft and abstract requirements. This profile should lead your questioning. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tKeep in mind that an interview is not the best predictor for future succes and not the best way to see if someone is actually good at their job. That's why we do assignments and pair sessions. With that knowledge you can focus on the more abstract and soft stuff which is impossible to measure with an assignment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's a basic structure that could help you and cover the basics, but make sure to actually prepare your interviews, don't wing it. You're wasting someone's time if you do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's an outline, you can shuffle the blocks of course.

This mainly applies to the section where you check work, drive and fit (also the three things you will be rating when making a decision).\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe recommend you come up with your own set and testing them out. What questions 'work' and which one don't? Share this with your hiring team! It's not per se a bad idea to ask the same kind of question to a person several times by several people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tUse the art of listening and follow up questions. Short questions like: can you elaborate on that? Why? Can you give an example? What effect did that have? How would you approach that situation now? What other options did you have? What happened? How? Can you explain?\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTypes of questions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are different types of questions.

Without notes, all you have to go on is your - pretty biased - memory and gut feeling. You prepared your interview, so write down the answers you get on the questions you thought were crucial to ask. You can use this in during the decisions and actually give examples: 'When I asked X, she answered Y and that testifies that she really understands the concept and did her homework'. \n\t\t\t\t\tUse Ratings\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRatings quantify the unquantifiable. Force yourself to chose and try to come up with an explanation for that rating. We rate from 1-3 and rate on Work, Drive and fit. \nUse the profile you made, your notes, the matrix and your overall findings to explain your ratings if need be. \n\t\t\t\t\tReduce bias\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEveryone is biased. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tYour bias doesn't help you make good decisions and evaluate a person. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can reduce bias by:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAwareness:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJust keep in mind that you and your colleagues - for example - have the tendency to like people who are like you (same former employer, education, village or even hobby: similarity bias). It's also pretty clear people tend to like pretty people more (beauty bias). Just keep stuff like that in the back of your mind and check yourself and your colleagues. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tStandardise:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStructure and recurring processes reduce bias. For example: if you are in awe of someone, you might want to skip that extra step or test because you assume he/she will nail it (halo effect). Or you could be more harsh in your questioning or reviewing because you already think someone is not a good match (conformation bias). Do the same thing for everyone and you get the best comparison.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUse ratings and justify\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuantify your feeling about a candidate by giving ratings and build a good argumentation around it.

I couldn\u2019t concentrate on my work \u2013 even simple tasks like responding to emails felt monumental. I was only able to work at a mere fraction of what I knew I was capable of.

The people who want to do their best and accomplish the most end up limiting themselves unintentionally.

If you're leading one or more people, Arbo will also ping you if someone is calling in sick frequently. If sickness absence is recurring, consider if there is a \n\t\t\tparticular pattern or underlying issues \n\t\t\tand initiate an open conversation about it.\n\t\t\tDo not be afraid of honest discussions, these discussions help to identify return to work barriers and underlying issues. They also help to outline the expectations of all parties involved.\n\t\t\tThe open discussions encourage your team member to voice her/his concerns and request help. From the team members point of view, these discussions help to effectively manage and monitor sickness absence, particularly in most complex cases such as recurring absences. It also helps to ensure that the sickness management process is structured, consistent, clear and fair.\n\n\t\t\tThe conversation \n\t\t\tTry initiating an open conversation by scheduling a meet on the first day of return to work, or at least as soon as you can. The purpose behind this conversation is not to judge someone for being absent. But it's meant to uncover the factors behind, or the cause of the absence. There is a good chance that you or Blendle can prevent the next absence by talking about this.\n\t\t\t\tExplain why you are having this conversation\n\t\t\t\tDon't ask right away about the problems and sickness. Make clear that it's about being absent.\n\t\t\t\tShare a list of dates and patterns relevant to being absent. \n\t\t\t\tTalk about how the absence worries you, how it effects the team and anyone close to the team member.\n\n\t\t\t\tHow to and what questions to ask:\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNotes\n\t\t\t\tAlways ask open questions.\n\t\t\t\tKnow your facts, this will prevent unnecessary discussions.

Just use your own judgement.\n\t\t\t\tIt's not our job to be sceptical or judgmental. We want to offer help where ever we can and manage the absence effectively. \n\t\t\t\tAsk HR for further support if needed. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGood reads:\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWe recently stumbled upon a \n\t\t\tFirstround Review blog\n\t\t\t about writing a manual for others about yourself.\n\t\t\t In short: we advise our leaders at Blendle to write a User Guide for their team members.\n\t\t\t The guide is a living and breathing document which gives really concrete pointers on how to work with you. It also gives more context and information about you, so people understand why you do things or act a certain way.\n\t\t\tAnswering these questions is a quick way to do it.

It's the center of my communications. It's easy for me to turn emails in to-do's. I have (and need) a system for follow up reminders, otherwise I lose track of if I need a reply from someone. (One of the reasons I hate phone conversations or instant messaging about work).\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI don't need acknowledgements of emails like \"got it\" or \"on it\". I expect you have read my email within a couple of days (except when you're on holiday).\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnly contact me by phone or instant message (telegram, whatsapp, slack, sms) when it's urgent, work related stuff.

I simply don't notice such things (and often don't care). My schedules are loose, my time often unscheduled and I don't care for routine and predictability. But, often my job requires it. It doesn't come naturally though, and the only way to make it work for me is to live by my calendar. At the same time, when I take the time to be creative, I'm very welcoming of the chaos that accompanies creative endeavor. Also, I'm very good at it: \n\t\t\t\t\t\tI know I'm productive when I spend time being creative.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI'm, unfortunately, not very polite.\n\n\t\t\t\tMy drive\n\t\t\t\t\tI have two goals in life. I want to be a great father and partner. And I want to make good information more accessible for more people. I know that last thing might sound super weird. But this is my professional purpose in life.\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm driven by being intellectually challenged, a feeling of purpose and creativity. I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and daughter a lot. I enjoy spending time at Blendle with my colleagues. At the same time, I love spending time alone. Reading or just fucking around with my computer (probably being on Reddit, Twitter or YouTube).\n\n\t\t\t\tHow to deal with me\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm extremely passionate about our mission. I might come off as combative because I will disagree and agree with you forcefully. Just in case it rubs you in the wrong way (which inevitably will happen), here are some possible expanations. Not all have to do with you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA) I genuinely enjoy discussions. Even when things get heated. It is the way I form opinions and ideas. That's why I don't take disagreements personal -- I merely see it as a way to evolve ideas and opinions.

I love when you can exist at 10,000 and 10 feet and clearly organize your priorities. Don\u2019t waste time on things that don\u2019t matter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou're not spending enough time thinking strategically. If you're too much in execution mode I'll get very frustrated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou aren\u2019t showing enough\u00a0rigor. I love it when you intensely evaluate the evidence, integrate that information from a wide range of sources, and apply sound judgment to make solid, smart decisions rapidly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou are shirking responsibility and not acting like an\u00a0owner. Be an agent for the change you want to make at this company and show fearlessness. It\u2019s ok to fail and take calculated risks. Speak your mind when something is broken and pair it with clever solutions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou aren\u2019t fostering\u00a0collaboration\u00a0and a positive, energetic environment. Know your strengths and weaknesses, understand different social styles, and show empathy, compassion and humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou aren\u2019t engaging in your own learning and teaching.

I'll either do this immediately (if there is nobody else in the room) or during our next 1:1.

We should try to resolve by doing (C). You are in this position because you are highly capable and talented, but if the situation stays like this, we're just not a good match.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tE) I'm not listening well. Maybe because I'm stressed, frustrated or scared about something unrelated to you. I may realize later and will apologize, particularly if you email me what you were saying. I might reply that I was the dummy and apologize. I respect you calling me out on this.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe way I work\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm a hard worker. But I'm also very lazy. I like to do things in the minimal amount of time necessary. I have a low tolerance for chores and repetitive tasks.\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm quite likely to procrastinate things that I don't like to do or are very complex.\n\t\t\t\t\tI can focus on the task at hand when there are high levels of motivation, but often find myself distracted by something more entertaining, interesting or worrisome.\n\t\t\t\t\tThere's a good chance I'm late, even if there isn't much of a reason for it. I tend to find and deliver excuses for my failure under such circumstances.\n\t\t\t\t\tI don't feel compelled to do things by the book. I love to engage in creative tasks, where rules must be broken for advancement to take place.\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm trying to split my time at work in 2 parts: contact with others and deep thinking. I need both in equal amounts to feel (and be) productive.\n\t\t\t\t\tI have the tendency to fix problems quickly and harshly. I immediately go into problem fixing mode, even while people might just want a listening ear.\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen I'm unsure of something, I'll arrange people around me with opposing ideas.

If you're ever debating including me on a communication, do it.\n\n\t\t\t\tFeedback and celebrating success\n\t\t\t\t\tCelebrating things is not part of my DNA. I'm not likely to celebrate things that go well, or reward good behavior. I don't hand out compliments easily. I know this is tough for some people, and I'm trying to get better at it.\n\t\t\t\t\tI also don't give others a lot of feedback spontaniously. Another thing I'm trying to get better at.\n\t\t\t\t\tI value feedback enormously. I value it in a one scentence email when I said something stupid or nice. I value it when you put a lot of time in it and give it to me in a more elaborate manner.\n\t\t\t\t\tI value feedback from everyone at the company, but I'm also aware that I don't come across as somebody with a lot of patience. Yet, I still hope you will give me feedback.\n\n\t\t\t\tStress\n\t\t\t\t\tI don't understand my own stress well. It's only after a stresful period that I can feel my body and mind being tired.

What I do know:\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I don't have options and have painted myself in a corner, I get very restless and stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI have days where I'm quite depressed and rather not want to get out of bed. This is correlated with my stress levels. At those days I'm feeling unhappy, anxious and irritable. I'm quite good at keeping my head in a storm, but when I'm stressed it costs me a lot of energy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI handle new, uncertain, unexpected, threatening or complex situations well.

Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  \n\t\t\tVision, mission and strategy\n\t\t\t\tFor people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.\n\t\t\t\tProactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.\n\t\t\t\t Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?). \n\t\t\t\tAsk your team\n\t\t\t\t if they know \n\t\t\t\twhy they are doing\n\t\t\t\t what they're doing. Remind them of it if you feel the need.\n\t\t\tVibe and morale \n\t\t\t\tWorking in a nice and vibrant environment is important to all of us. A place where people are motivated, willing and positive. Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:\n\t\t\t\tMake it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?\n\t\t\t\tAddress it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag. Is it one person? One situation? One team? One project? Or is it more?\n\n\t\t\tCulture\n\t\t\t\tLead by example when it comes to culture. We tried pinning down our DNA by writing down our operating principles but we came to the conclusion it's essentially all about you. The people themselves are the culture and we guard that culture. What you stand for, what you believe in and how we treat each other is part of our DNA. So be yourself and keep expressing yourself to your team. 'This is not how we do things' is a totally fine comment. Don't forget to explain why though :).\n\t\t\t\tCheck our page about culture and values here:\n\n\t\t\tRelate and care personally\n\t\t\t\tThe people around you are probably one of the reasons you like working at Blendle.

How do you get the most out of people while being a great employer? How do you deal with performance reviews, salary changes, learning and development, recruitment, giving and getting feedback, hiring and firing?\n\tBlendle has a mission to make quality journalism more accessible. In the last three years, we've built the HR operation at Blendle from scratch. We've tried to answer the most pressing questions. We learned through trial and error.\n\tIt has struck me how little information companies share publicly about their people operations. We would all gain a lot by being more open about what works well and what doesn't.\n\tThat's why we decided to make Blendle's Employee Handbook publicly accessible. You can find the result of three years of hard work here.\n\tWhen I pressed 'publish public' I got a sense of why there is so little practical information about this topic out there. It's pretty scary to just publish it. So, here's an instant disclaimer: this is a living document, it's not perfect and we'll improve it. Still, I hope that more companies will press the 'publish public'-button. I hope that \n\ttogether \n\twe can take the concept of 'working' to the next level. So: have fun reading.
