      "To build a portfolio of AI projects, it is important to start small and gradually progress to more complex undertakings. Begin by identifying a business problem in a specific domain and brainstorm potential AI solutions. Communicate the value of your project to colleagues, mentors, and managers to gain their support and feedback. As you work on projects, focus on clear and effective communication of your accomplishments. Additionally, leadership skills are valuable in larger AI projects, even if you are not in a formal leadership position. By showcasing a progression of projects, from simple to complex, you can demonstrate your skill development over time.\n"
